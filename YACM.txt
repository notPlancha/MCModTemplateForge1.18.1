Ultranite
less strong than netherite, same as diamond, but each thing has a natural ability
helmet has incirsed swimming speed
chestplate has thorns 1 above the level
legs decreased kockback
boots have heather falling above the max
full armor gives incriesed swiming x3, thorns x4 ( or enough for an enderman, wich comes first), no kockback, no fall damage
